# overall Description
## 2.1 Product perpecive 
his subsection of hte SRS should put the product into perspective with other related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should indentify interfaces between that system and the software.

This subsection should also describe how the software operates insides various constraints. For example, these constraints could include.
## 2.1.1 System Interfaces 
## 2.1.2 User Interfaces 
## 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces 
## 2.1.4 Software Interfaces 
## 2.1.5 Communication interfaces 
## 2.1.6 Memory 
## 2.1.7 Operations
## 2.1.8 Site adaption requirements 

## 2.2 Product funtions  
## 2.3 User characteristics 
## 2.4 Constrains 
## 2.5 Assumptions
