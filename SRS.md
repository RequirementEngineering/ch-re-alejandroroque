# overall Description
## 2.1 Product perpecive 
his subsection of hte SRS should put the product into perspective with other related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should indentify interfaces between that system and the software.

This subsection should also describe how the software operates insides various constraints. For example, these constraints could include.
## 2.1.1 System Interfaces 
This should list each system interface and identify the functionality of the software to accomplish the system requirement and the interface description to match the system.
## 2.1.2 User Interfaces 
This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users.
All the aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system.
## 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces 
This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software products and the hardware component of the system.
## 2.1.4 Software Interfaces 
This should specify the use of other required software products and interfaces with other applications systems.
## 2.1.5 Communication interfaces 
This should specify the various interfaces to communication such as local network protocols, etc.
## 2.1.6 Memory 
This should specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and secondary memory.
## 2.1.7 Operations
This should specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as:
The various nodes of operations in the user organization.
## 2.1.8 Site adaption requirements 
This should define the requirements for any data or initialization sequences that are specific to a given site, mission, or operational mode.
## 2.2 Product funtions  
This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform.
## 2.3 User characteristics 
This subsection of the SRS should describe those general characteristics of the intender users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.
## 2.4 Constrains 
This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options
## 2.5 Assumptions  
This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factor that affect the requirements stated in the SRS.

# Specific Requeriments
This section of the SRS should contain all of the software requirements to a leve of detail sufficient to enable desginers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.
